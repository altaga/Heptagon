# Introduction and Problem

Over the last decade, most economies in Latin America and the Caribbean have displayed sustained growth and macroeconomic stability leading to the emergence of growing middle classes. Despite these advances, poverty and inequality levels remain high and financial exclusion still affects important sectors of both the urban and the rural population, which can hinder future economic and social development.

El Salvador’s experiment with Bitcoin has justifiably intrigued much of the financial world. That focus might be missing the much larger story. Regardless of the outcome of El Salvador’s cryptocurrency venture, mobile phones, fintech, DeFi, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrency, are poised to dramatically alter banking and commerce, and potentially economic stability, throughout the region.

Nevertheless there are several challenges, an estimated 70% of economic transactions in Latin America are all cash. And just 50% has bank accounts. But, in contrast 78% has a cellphone with internet connection and among those more than 99% use Instant messenger apps. We think that the region is set to jump this chasm and generate new economies based in these technologies such as the jump several countries had from nothing to mobile phones without passing through landlines.
